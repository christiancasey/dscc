This folder contains three things:
1. ```folder_setup```: This is the folder setup that SAFBuilder expects; i.e. a .csv file with metadata as created by the Python scripts I sent you; note that the filename column in concatenated with | (i.e. the pipe character) and that SAFBuilder uses this column to associate files with the corresponding row of metadata
2. an unzipped version of the SAFBuilder output
3. a zipped version of the SAFBuilder output; with dot files manually removed so that it can be uploaded to FDA without error
